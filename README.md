# Facial-Recognition
The project Facial-Recognition System is a Artificial Intelligent system that will recognize the person on camera. Using interactive GUI anyone can easily learn to use the complete system.

This system will provide identification and user privacy and flexibility. This identification is used to access an application, system or service.

Facial-Recognition is a method of biometric identification that uses that body measures, in this case face and head, to verify the identity of a person through its facial biometric pattern and data. The technology collects a set of unique biometric data of each person associated with their face and facial expression to identify, verify and/or authenticate a person.
